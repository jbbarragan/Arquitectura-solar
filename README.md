Hello! I’m Joshua Barragán. I’ve developed and continue improving this web application that will allow you to view solar graphs according to your position in the world, as well as observe the behavior of temperatures with EPW files.

This page is very simple to use, feel free to play around with it. You just need to clone the repository and run app.py, which will start the page and all its features.
Make sure to have all the Python libraries installed by running the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt

In the templates folder, you’ll find all the HTML and JS that build the graphical part. In static, your solar graph will be stored, and in uploads, 
you can view comfort temperatures and auxiliary CSV files with the important information. 
Additionally, I’ve provided some example files for you to use: EPW for your climate data, and OBJ for your 3D objects.
